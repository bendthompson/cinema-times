# Cinema Times🍿
Using web scraping and calling API's to source data for all my nearby cinemas and display it in one place.

# Skills I used/learned

🎞️ Called API's using the requests package, handling response errors and sending dynamic queries

📽️ Streamlined code to minimize number of http requests and improve runtime

🎬 Scraped html code using the BeautifulSoup package. Had to use various BSoup methods to work around messily structured websites

📹 Gained valuable experience about the importance of data architecture and creating a data pipeline 

🎦 Used a wide range of Streamlit features to create a clear and robust frontend

🎥 Made a well structured repo with importable packages to keep main file tidy

📸 Used RegEx with English and Japanese text
